## Download

Head over to the [Releases](https://github.com/soffes/contrast/releases) page and download `Contrast-x.x.zip`.

## Building

Simply open the Xcode project and run the app. Contrast uses Swift Package Manager for dependencies, so Xcode will get these for you automatically. You may need to change the code signing team to be your own if it gives you an error about code signing.

Last tested with Xcode 14.

Enjoy!
